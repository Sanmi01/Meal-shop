# Getting Started with Create React App


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 1. How to Run The Code
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. After that you run npm install to install the necessary packages in the package.json file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 2. If I had more time
I would have learnt how to write automated testing for react applications and created tests for this applications. I also would have written better documentation for the app.
